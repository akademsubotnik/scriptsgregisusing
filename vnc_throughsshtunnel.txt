  FAQ
  Q: How can I run wayvnc in headless mode/over an SSH session?
  A: Set the environment variables WLR_BACKENDS=headless and WLR_LIBINPUT_NO_DEVICES=1 before starting sway, then set WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 and run wayvnc. 
  For older versions of sway, WAYLAND_DISPLAY is wayland-0. Try that if wayland-1 doesn't work.
3. start wayvnc (wayvnc 0.0.0.0 &)
4. start a putty session to connect to remote workstation running wayvnc server (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmRu_Ah1cb8)
5. after connecting with putty, launch vnc client on local computer to, "localhost:0" and CONNECT!!!
